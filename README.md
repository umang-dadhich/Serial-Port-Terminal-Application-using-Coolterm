Introduction
* Sensor data depends on the connection as well as on noise so we need to check the value of
Sensor.
* The value must be printed on the screen.
* To print the value on the PC screen we need a communication channel.
* A serial communication link between the PC and microcontroller is used to transfer data from
  microcontroller to PC.
* Software tools such as CoolTerm, TeraTerm, etc. are used to establish the serial
communication and to print the data on the PC screen.
