# Serial-Port-Terminal-Application-using-Coolterm
Introduction
* Sensor data depends on the connection as well as on noise so we need to check the value of
Sensor.
* The value must be printed on the screen.
* To print the value on the PC screen we need a communication channel.
* A serial communication link between the PC and microcontroller is used to transfer data from
  microcontroller to PC.
* Software tools such as CoolTerm, TeraTerm, etc. are used to establish the serial
communication and to print the data on the PC screen.

# HyperTerminal
* Software Tools that enables serial communication between the desktop/laptop and the
microcontroller are termed as HyperTerminal Tool.
Examples: CoolTerm, TeraTerm, etc.
* For our experiments, it is required to ensure that there is some HyperTerminal installed on the computer.
* Will enable serial data communication with the microcontroller.
* HyperTerminal connections in the present context shall be made using USB port.

# CoolTerm
* In our experiments we shall be using CoolTerm.
* Available on a wide variety of platforms.
* It can be downloaded from several sites:
   http://download.cnet.com/CoolTerm/3000-2383_4-10915882.html|
   http://coolterm.en.lo4d.com/
* After extracting the file we shall get the CoolTerm.exe file.
* This will be used for serial connection between the PC/laptop and the STM32 kit.

# Settings on CoolTerm
* For proper data communication, proper settings have to be made on the HyperTerminal
software.
* We shall explain the steps for CoolTerm.
* The default serial configuration in CoolTerm is 9600 bauds, 8-bit data.
* If you have not set any bauds rate in the program, then no need to change on this.
Else it can be set to match with the program.
